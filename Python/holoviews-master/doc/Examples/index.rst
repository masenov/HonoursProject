Examples
********

This collection of examples demonstrate interesting uses of HoloViews
that go beyond the tutorial material. Suitable material includes
application of HoloViews to real-world data, examples of advanced
usage and demonstrations of how HoloViews may be extended, including
third-party libraries that feature HoloViews integration.

We hope this set of examples will be a useful way of discovering what
is possible with HoloViews. We welcome your submissions for inclusion on
this list as HoloViews is applied to new domains.

Notebooks
---------

This collection of IPython notebooks shows real-world examples of how
HoloViews may be used:

* `Simulating a simple reaction-diffusion system <Reaction-diffusion.html>`_:
  Demonstration of how HoloViews may be used for viewing simulated data, adapted from
  this free recipe from the `IPython Cookbook <https://ipython-books.github.io/featured-05/>`_.

* `Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map <Logistic_Map.html>`_: Adaptation
  of a `blog post <http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/>`_
  by Geoff Boeing that shows how HoloViews makes exploration of this fascinating
  subject easier and more succinct.

* `HoloViews for machine learning
  <http://philippjfr.com/blog/kaggle-bci-challenge-visualizing-eeg-data-in-holoviews/>`_:
  Entry into a machine learning competition for EEG classification.

* `Marking summary statistics
  <http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1-cg/assignments/Inf1-CG_Assignment1_Scores.html>`_:
  Visualizing the marking results of an undergraduate assignment with
  HoloViews.


Extensions
----------

Examples of how the core functionality offered by HoloViews may be
extended in new (and unexpected!) directions:

* `Interactive plots with mpld3
  <http://philippjfr.com/blog/interactive-plots-with-holoviews-and-mpld3/>`_:
  Example usage of the mpld3 rendering backend allowing you to
  generate D3.js-based plots with interactive widgets.

* `Interfacing HoloViews with Julia
  <http://philippjfr.com/blog/interfacing-holoviews-with-julia/>`_: A
  prototype of a basic interface to the Julia programming language.


External Projects
-----------------

Third party libraries, simulators and toolkits that make use of
HoloViews for easier visualization and analysis:

* `ImaGen library <http://ioam.github.io/imagen>`_: Generate
  HoloViews `Image <https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Elements.html#Image>`_
  and 
  `RGB <https://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Tutorials/Elements.html#RGB>`_ 
  patterns from mathematical functions.

* `Topographica tutorials <http://topographica.org/Tutorials/>`_:
  Neural simulator using HoloViews (plus publications `Stevens et
  al. (2013)
  <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/papers/stevens.jn13.pdf>`_,
  `Gee (2014)
  <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/papers/gee.ms14.pdf>`_, and
  `Fischer (2014)
  <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/papers/gee.ms14.pdf>`_ with
  `associated notebook
  <http://ioam.github.io/media/topo/gcal_all.html>`_)
