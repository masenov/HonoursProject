About Us
========

HoloViews is part of the `IOAM <https://github.com/ioam>`_, 
the Github organization for the Computational Systems 
Neuroscience Group at the University of Edinburgh. We are
members of the Edinburgh `Doctoral Training Center in Neuroinformatics
<http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/>`_ and the Edinburgh
`Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation <http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/>`_.

When we are not working on HoloViews, we are computational neuroscientists
working on large-scale models of the mammalian visual system. We are also
developers of the `Topographica neural simulator <https://ioam.github.io/topographica/>`_
which we mostly use to build computational models of the primary visual cortex (V1).

**Jean-Luc Stevens :** PhD candidate investigating the temporal
dynamics of V1 activity response.

**Philipp Rudiger :** PhD candidate investigating anatomically
realistic models of V1 development and how these relate to natural
image statistics.

**James A. Bednar:** Associate Professor and Director of the DTC,
researching biologically realistic computational models of human and
animal visual systems. 

HoloViews also includes code from Christopher Ball and Jefferson Provost.
