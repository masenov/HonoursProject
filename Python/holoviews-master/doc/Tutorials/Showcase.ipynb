    "**HoloViews encapsulates your continuous or discrete data into storable, composable, sliceable objects, leveraging matplotlib for visualization and IPython Notebook for maximum productivity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preserves your raw data while allowing rapid, interactive exploratory analysis.\n",
    "* Builds even complex, composite visualizations that are easily customized.\n",
    "* Succinct, declarative style allows you to keep all the necessary code visible, ensuring your workflow is transparent and fully reproducible.\n",
    "* You can select, slice, or transform only the relevant data that is currently of interest.\n",
    "* You can store your raw data as HoloViews objects via pickling, for later analysis or visualization even without the code that generated it.\n",
    "* Strong support for the IPython Notebook, including tab-completion throughout and powerful IPython magics (with all functionality also available in pure Python).\n",
    "* Seamless (optional) interaction with Pandas Dataframes.\n",
    "* [And much, much more!](../features)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook/) environment and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) allow you to do interactive exploration and analysis of your data and measurements, using the rich [ecosystem of tools available in Python](http://scipy.org).  However, your notebooks can very quickly fill up with verbose, specialized plotting code whenever you want to visualize your data, which is often.  To make all this practical, you can use HoloViews to greatly improve your productivity, requiring orders of magnitude fewer lines of code and letting you focus on your data itself, not on writing code to visualize and display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will show some of the main features of HoloViews, and why it is useful for scientists and engineers."

    "HoloViews objects like ``Image`` and ``Curve`` are a great way to work with your data, because they display so easily and flexibly, yet preserve the raw data (the Numpy array in this case) in the ``.data`` attribute.

Because the HoloViews code is so succinct, you don't need to hide it away in some difficult-to-maintain external script; you can simply type what you want to see right in the notebook, changing it at will and being able to come back to your analysis just as you left it.\n",

All of these can be combined easily to create even quite complex plots with a minimum of code to write or maintain."

    "The better way is to move all or large ranges of your data into HoloViews Container objects, organizing it in a way that is meaningful to you.  Once it is all organized, you can then slice, select, sample, and animate whatever combination of data you want to analyze at any given time, using convenient and succinct HoloViews operations, always yielding something that can be visualized directly and with no further coding.  The ``+`` and ``*`` operations are an easy way to generate some of these containers, but there are other containers that work in very different ways that are important for other visualizations and analyses, such as parameter space exploration.\n",

    "Exporting data in HoloViews format is very simple, and adding HoloViews export support to a program requires very little code.  In fact, it's mostly the same code as in the easy way, just done for you by a program.  For instance, all of the data generated from the [ImaGen](http://ioam.github.io/imagen) image-generation library can be viewed directly as a HoloViews ``Image`` or ``RGB`` object.  With just a few lines of code added to the base classes in the project, ImaGen objects can be viewed immediately within IPython notebook without needing any matplotlib programming.  ImaGen also exploits some of the general-purpose data structures provided by HoloViews, for its own implementation, but that is not required just to be able to export data back into HoloViews.\n",

    "A much richer interface to HoloViews is provided by the FeatureMapper library, which is mainly used as the data-analysis package for the Topographica neural simulator.  You can see the power of HoloViews in the [Topographica Tutorials](http://ioam.github.io/topographica/Tutorials/) notebooks; with very little code users can do even quite complex analyses on continuous data without having to deal with the underlying discrete array data structures.\n",

    "Nearly all of the HoloViews tutorials focus on interactive use within the IPython Notebook interface, because the rich display system of the notebook allows you to view HoloViews objects as soon as you have defined them, with no further coding or files required.  However, nothing in HoloViews requires IPython, and so you can also use it within your pure Python programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can easily import ``holoviews.core`` into your own program, which only has Numpy and Param as dependencies, both of which have no required dependencies. This will allow you to create and export HoloViews objects, either to save to disk for later analysis, or when called in a Python session.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the full features of HoloViews in a purely non-interactive mode, without IPython notebook or any windowing systems.  I.e., you can create HoloViews objects in Python, customize them with whatever styling options you like, and then [render them directly](Options) to a ``.png``, ``.gif``, or ``.svg`` file on disk, perhaps to serve them directly to the web as part of an automated analysis workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, HoloViews itself is designed to be extensible.  If you want, you can [directly manipulate the matplotlib objects](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/wiki/Using-HoloViews-without-IPython) constructed by HoloViews, e.g. to add functionality not currently offered by HoloViews.  You can also subclass or copy any existing [element](Elements) type to change its behavior or add features you need.  Note that HoloViews is explicitly designed as a general-purpose library, focusing on visualizations and analyses common to very many different areas of research, but researchers in different fields may want to build toolboxes of additional specialized plot types suitable for their domain.  Once defined, these new visualizations will all seamlessly combine (adjoin, overlay, etc.) with existing HoloViews objects."
