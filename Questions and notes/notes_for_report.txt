Introduction
Background - visual fields, recepetive fiels, tuning curves, population coding
Visual illusions and previous work?
Design - decision
Implementation - Matlab and Python(Holoviews)
Experiments - recurrent neural network, passive model, dynamic model for different orientation (two neurons, two bars, without recurrent, with recurrent connections, three/six bars, multiple bars)
Evaluation
Timeline - put numbers and then legend at the bottom
Conclusions

substract the flanker orientation (biases not absolute value)
figures about elastica - neuron in the middle and how it connects to other neurons
