Hi Martin,

Glad to see your interest in this project! 

I would suggest one of two papers to check out, depending on what you want to know more on. 

If you want to know more about the kind of illusions and biases we will study, have a look at the review paper Schwartz et al (2007) - Space and time in visual context (attached). Especially note how they intuitively explain illusions from neural activities, figure 3. 

If you want to know more about the kind of neural network we would be building to study these biases, take a look at the model in Zhaoping (1999) - Contextual influences in V1 as a basis for pop out and asymmetry in visual search (also attached). This is bit a more technical paper, and gives you an idea of the kind of maths involved in simulating a neural network. The results presented are not directly relevant to our project, so you can safely ignore the bulk of this paper. 

Hope that helps, and let us know if you have any other questions. 

Sander
