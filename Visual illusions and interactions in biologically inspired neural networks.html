</p><p><strong>Principal goal of the project:</strong>
Finding the influence of biased representations across the network
</p><p><strong>Description of the project:</strong>
We experience many illusions in our perception of orientation, where a line seems tilted when it's not. These illusions are often explained by the line's representation in the visual cortex. Normally, the theory goes, a line in isolation is encoded in the visual cortex by a group of neurons responsive to specific orientations, with the neurons responsive to the line's orientation responding strongest, and other neurons responding less. Imagine this as a 'hill' of activity centred around the line's orientation. However, when more lines are added to the scene these activate their own group of neurons, which through their connectivity modulate the activity of other neurons, sometimes shifting their response resulting in a bias, thus explaining biased perception.</p><p>This theory is well established, but has usually been tested in phenomenological models: the influence from the additional lines on neurons is calculated directly, rather than being mediated through other neurons. The resulting biased representation in the neurons then has no further effect. In a full dynamical model however, one would expect some dynamical interaction between groups of neurons. As an example, consider two groups of neurons representing two different lines (A and B), in  a stable situation. If one changes the orientation of line A, the neural responses to this line will shift, which in turn will shift the response to line B through the neural connections. This latter shift will in turn change the responses to A again, and so on.</p><p>It is unknown what effect these kind of dynamical interactions have on the perception of tilt. Does the situation always stabilise and thus lead to a single tilt perception, however biased? Or is there a regime of connectivity in which the neural responses oscillate, resulting in turn in an ever changing perception of the lines' orientation? How does this relate to our perception? In this project this will be studied by building a simple model of the visual cortex, in which we change the nature and strength of the connections between neurons. The resulting network behaviour will then be linked to perception.</p><p>Supervised jointly with Sander Keemink (PhD student)</p><p>
